# LikeTheBeastRemastered

Like The Beast Remastered is a remastered version of the basic 3D game. The game is based on a Cyberpunk style and the goal is to get the most points at the end of each game. The player controls only the mouse and must shoot flying robots or spiders to earn points. A quest system is implemented in the game so that the player has objectives during his game sessions.
